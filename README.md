# Final Module20 Group3

## Topic Introduction
Predict Austin, TX House Sale Prices Using A Machine Learning Model\.

### Reason we chose this topic
Austin, TX is one of the hottest markets as observed from the sales prices over years 2018 to early 2021. The market has been on a positive incline over these years, and we would like to discover new insights and build a machine learning model to predict the future sales prices per specific features as provided from the dataset

### Description of our source of data 
The data set selected for our review and analysis originates from a project at Northwestern University. The csv file was discovered and pulled from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/ericpierce/austinhousingprices)\.

### Questions we hope to answer with our data
We hope to discover which features and variables correlate closely to the house listing price and observe how the Austin market price(s) would change in the future\.

## Data Set
The initial data set from kaggle span from years 2018 to January 2021 and has 15,171 rows and 47 columns of the sales data from Austin, TX\.

### EDA and Cleaning Data Set
1. **FINDING**: Single Family(94%), Condo(3%) and Townhouse(1%) make up most of data. **ACTION**: Removed all other home type\.
2. **FINDING**: Possible outliers were lastestPrice, lotSizeSqFt, livingAreaSqFt and numOfBathrooms.  **ACTION**: Corrected typo(s), inputted typical numbers, corrected data based on homeType and latestPrice, dropped irrelevant cities and used IQR method (used standard 1.5)\.
3. **FINDING**: Bool type data. **ACTION**: Changed to binary data as 0/1\.

### Result
Our final data set has 12933 rows and 50 columns with 0 missing value\.

## Description of communication protocols
Slack chat and normal class hours are our primary communication channel. On top of these sessions, we will have seperate meeting time via google meet during week and weekend\.
As an alternative, we have each team member's email for supplemental communication medium\.

## Database
Team members present a provisional database that stands in for the final database and accomplishes:
- sample data that mimics expected final database structure or schema
- draft machine learning module is connected to provisional database

## Machine Learning Model
Present a provisional machine learning model that stands in for the final machine learning model and accomplishes:
- takes in data from provisional database
- Outputs label(s) for input data

## Google Slides Presentation & Storyboard 
The team has jointly utilized python, Tableau, and Json to build a Google Slides Presentation, Tableau Storyboard and an interactive Dashboard\.
