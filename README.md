# Final Module20 Group3
## FIRST SEGMENT Presentation Draft

- Selected Topic - Austin TX Housing Price Prediction\.
- Reason we chose this topic - The Austin Housing market is one of the hottest real estate markets in 2021, and we wanted to discover any insights and create a machine learning model to predict the future listing prices of houses after reviewing and analyzing the historical Austin housing market data\.
- Description of our source of data - The data set selected for our review and analysis originates from a project at Northwestern University. The csv file is located at [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/ericpierce/austinhousingprices)\.
- Questions we hope to answer with our data - We are hoping to discover which features and variables correlate closely to the house listing price and observe how the Austin market price(s) would change in the future\.

### Data Set
We have initial data set that has 15171 rows and 47 columns\.
### EDA and Cleaning Data Set
1. **FINDING**: Single Family(94%), Condo(3%) and Townhouse(1%) making up most of data. **ACTION**: Removed all other home type\.
2. **FINDING**: Possible outliers on lastestPrice, lotSizeSqFt, livingAreaSqFt and numOfBathrooms.  **ACTION**: Corrected typo, Inputted typical numbers, Corrected data based on homeType and latestPrice, Dropped irrelevant cities and Used IQR method (used standard 1.5)\.
3. **FINDING**: Bool type data. **ACTION**: Changed to binary data as 0/1\.
### Result
Our final data set has 12933 rows and 50 columns with 0 missing value\.

### Description of communication protocols
Slack chat and normal class hours are our primary communication channel. On top of these, we will have seperate meeting time via google meet during week and weekend\.
Lastly, each team member's email would be back up communicate channel\.


- Each team member has at least four commits(for first segment)


Present a provisional machine learning model that stands in for the final machine learning model and accomplishes:
- takes in data from provisional database
- Outputs label(s) for input data

Team members present a provisional database that stands in for the final database and accomplishes:
- sample data that mimics expected final database structure or schema
- draft machine learning module is connected to provisional database

## SECOND SEGMENT
